# Advent of Code

![Last Commit on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/gillesmag/advent-of-code.svg)

As many people, I have decided to participate in the Advent of Code this year as
well (after last year's [utter
failure](https://github.com/gillesmag/advent-of-code-2019) to finish). This
year, I wanted to try learning [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as I've been very
intrigued by the language as a replacement for my personal Python development
(as well as some courses that I will be taking in the new year).

My primary goal with this repository is to start from basically zero Julia
knowledge and slowly build my knowledge with each day, refactoring earlier code
to be better (in terms of maintenance, reusability, etc.). As such, the code
quality will not be great in the beginning (as I am still learning the
language), but that's ok.
